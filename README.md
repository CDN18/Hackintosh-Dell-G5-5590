## About

This is my "Hackintosh Diary", will be using it to maintain a triple boot Dell G5 5590 a80p between macOS, Arch Linux and Windows.  

Don't directly use my EFI folder, your computer won't boot cause it has CFG Lock disabled and other post install stuff.

Vanilla Boot could be accomplished using OPENCORE USB BOOT folder. Use this folder to make a bootable USB disk with macOS Catalina (tested with 10.5.5).

Used [Vanilla Laptop Guide](https://dortania.github.io/vanilla-laptop-guide/) from [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/), but laptop and desktop guide was merged into [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/).

Most work is done post installation, be prepared to read a lot. CFG Lock is difficult to understand but very simple to execute. Disabling CFG Lock and dGPU using [Optimus Method](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/Laptops/laptop-disable.html#optimus-method) has major impact on battery life.

If you like this guide and can help with any value, please buy me a coffee :coffee:

## INSTALLATION

Follow [Vanilla Laptop Guide](https://dortania.github.io/vanilla-laptop-guide/) and use MacBookPro16,1 SMBIOS (remember to insert your generated data at platform info section). Setup config.plist using [Coffee Lake Plus](https://dortania.github.io/vanilla-laptop-guide/OpenCore/config-laptop.plist/coffee-lake-plus.html). Read every guide very carefully BEFORE start and know what you're going to do beforehand.

**ACPI changes:**

- SSNC-PLUG - CPU0 into PP00 -> Processor ID on this machine is PP00

**DELL SPECIFICS config.plist:**

- UpdateSMBIOSMode = Custom
- CustomSMBIOSGuid = True
- Audio layout-id = 15 (other channels worked, but 15 offered better stability and sound quality overall)

**Patching CFG Lock**

- Download BIOS from Dell website (version must be the same, variable can change after updates). 
- Dump bios with DecompNewDell.py (used Python3)
- Open dumped bios with UEFITool
- Search for "CFG Lock, VarStoreInfo (VarOffset/VarName)". Variable name come just after (in my case, using BIOS 1.13.2, was 0x5C4)

`One Of: CFG Lock, VarStoreInfo (VarOffset/VarName): 0x5C4, VarStore: 0x1 [...]

The steps above I followed to find the correct CFG Lock variable name. After that, simply boot into Modified GRUB Shell and change variable from 0x5C4 to 0x00:

- Prepare EFI Boot Disk using [Disabling CFG Lock](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/extras/msr-lock#disabling-cfg-lock) instructions and patch using **setup_var_3 0x5C4 0x00**

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Battery drain after wake from sleep. Already tried different methods without success (Optimus Method, Bumblebee Method, GPU Spoof, Flag device in config.plist... None of then worked). I'm searching for solutions but for now I'm shutting down laptop instead of putting to sleep.
- Quicktime and iTunes show artifacts while full screen. IINA runs fine, tested .mp4, .mkv and .ts movies
- Sometimes unplugging/replugging power adaptor causes keyboard lag and I have to reboot in order to resolve the issue.
- Sometimes unplugging/replugging quickly causes laptop to crash. I'm testing SSDT-XOSI.aml, found somewhere that it would fix the problem, but didn't resolve it yet.
- Headphone port don't work with mic. I'm researching how to make a custom layout for AppleALC in order to fix it.

## CHANGELOG

**September 04 2020** (v1.5)

- Working Ethernet using RealtekRTL8111.kext (Changed OSBundleRequired from Network-Root to Root inside kext's Info.plist)
- Some kexts are development version instead of release cause resolved some issues. Next week I'll put release version when Acidanthera commit.
- I'm not using current Voodol2C/VoodooPS2Controller kext because latest version broken multitouch support with this laptop.

**August 03 2020** (v1.4) 

- Removed NullEthernet.kext (don't need anymore cause installed Fenvi Wi-Fi card)
- Updated OpenCore to version 0.6.0
- Updated Kexts:
  - NoTouchID-1.0.4-RELEASE
  - WhateverGreen-1.4.1-RELEASE
  - Lilu-1.4.6-RELEASE
  - VirtualSMC-1.1.5-RELEASE
  - AppleALC-1.5.1-RELEASE
  - VoodooPS2Controller-2.1.6-RELEASE
  - NVMeFix-1.0.3-RELEASE

**August 02 2020** (v1.3)

- Minor adjustments

**July 17 2020** (v1.1) 

- Fixed USB mapping with USBInjectAll.kext + SSDT-UIAC.dsl generated by Hackintool

**July 16 2020** (v1.1) 

- USB mapped
- Fixed error that disconnecting device from USB-C port cause high usage of kernel_task. USB-C is not working with USB3 for now.
- I think dGPU is turning on after sleep cause of temperature changes and estimated battery. Before sleep idles between 45-50. After wake idles at 55-60 degrees.

**July 14 2020** (v1.0) - STABLE

- Disabled dGPU using [Optimus Method](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/Laptops/laptop-disable.html#optimus-method)
